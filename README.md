# RIS-Group-Project
A TO-DO application for task management supports creating and deleting categories/groups of tasks that form a whole. Each group can contain any number of smaller tasks, which can be assigned one of the statuses: Done, WIP (Work In Progress), or Unfinished. Based on the status of these subtasks, the application calculates and displays our progress in the form of a colored progress bar. Each subtask can also be deleted.

### Our Vision
Our TO-DO application is designed for easy to track task management via task groups. These task groups allow users to organize related tasks together and track their progress more easily through easy to read visual interface. Besides simple task recording, implementing task groups goes beyond standard task tracking applications by offering structured handling and management of complex tasks. Further enhancing that is task progression tracking. By implementing status codes users can now visually see the progress of each task group by nicely color coded progress bar. All this together enables users to quickly assess how close to the completion they are with any particular task which can range from simple to more complex.

Application is intended for any user that prefers visual task management instead of monotonous alternatives. It is great for tracking simple tasks but shines when it comes to complex projects where users can easily track their progress of tasks that require multiple smaller tasks to be completed. Therefore the application will find it's way mostly into hands of students, freelancers and team managers who work on shared projects.

Applications function wise offer all the necessary functions like creating, editing and deleting both individual as well as group tasks via simple interface interactions. This highly improves productivity and ease of use, which keeps users motivated to keep their tasks recorded and organized as they won't see task management as a chore, but rather a tool that improves their productivity.

## Vocabulary

| Word | Discription |
| ------------- | ------------- |
Task |	Task is the main data processed by our configuration. In fact, it represents a task or simply a reminder that the user must complete and write it down in our application so he doesn't forget. In addition, the application offers him the option of appropriately marking, grouping and describing this task.
Task name	| With task name, the user names an individual task. The naming can be arbitrary and is basically of the string type. For each new task, the program automatically assigns an ID, which is a unique key for each task.
Task disription	| Task description represents a space where the user can describe an individual task. The description can be as long as you like and is helpful for the user to find their way around when reviewing past tasks.
Task group	| The user has the option of grouping individual tasks into groups. It does this by assigning them a task group. Tasks with the same task group belong to the same group. This makes it easier for the user to carry out more demanding tasks, as they can be divided into several parts.
Task status	| The task performed by the user goes through three different statuses: Unfinished, WIP (Working in process) and Done. Depending on the state of the current task, the user can mark it on the application.
Task action	| Task action allows the user to edit or delete an individual task.

## New Functionality: Progress Bar

### Description
We have implemented a new progress bar functionality in the Advanced TO-DO List application. This feature visually represents the progress of tasks within each task group, providing a clear and immediate understanding of how much work has been completed.

### How It Works
The progress bar calculates the percentage of completed tasks within each task group. It dynamically updates based on the status of the tasks:
- **Green**: 100% completed tasks.
- **Yellow**: More than 50% but less than 100% completed tasks.
- **Red**: 50% or fewer completed tasks.

The progress bar is displayed within each task group's row in the main table, showing the exact percentage of tasks completed.

### How to Test the New Functionality
1. **Run the Application**: Ensure your development server is running.
2. **Navigate to the Home Page**: Open the application in your browser and go to the home page.
3. **View Task Groups**: You will see a table listing all task groups. Each group will have a progress bar indicating the completion percentage of its tasks.
4. **Update Task Status**: Change the status of tasks within a group to see the progress bar update in real-time.
5. **Create and Delete Tasks**: Add new tasks or delete existing ones to observe changes in the progress bar.
